# ToDo List
A note-taking app for managing to-dos, allowing users to create, remove, and organize projects and associated tasks. This was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

## Motivation
This project was made to:
- Practice building a user-friendly interface with efficient task management features
- Learn how to modularize application logic
- Explore the use of local storage for data persistence

## Quick Start
Publicly available at the following link: https://paulreaver.github.io/ToDo-List/

## Usage
Users can create a new project by entering a project name in the left column and clicking the checkmark icon. They are free to add as many projects as needed, and can delete them by clicking the trash can icon next to each project. A default 'General' project is always available. 

Similarly, users can add notes to any project by filling out a form at the top of the page, where they can input a title, description, priority, and due date. Notes are added by clicking the checkmark icon or can be cleared by pressing the 'X'. Once a note is added, it can be edited or deleted at any time. 

Importantly, all changes are automatically saved, ensuring that progress is retained even if the page is refreshed or the user navigates away.
